            time trying to find a mastermind. I tried calling people who I knew were into business, but they just had no clue what
            a mastermind was all about. In fact, they really weren't trying to be in business, at least not right now. Lesson learned.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I decided to try again. This time I called up some friends who I knew were in businesses. But they were just too
            busy doing their own thing to have time to be in a weekly meeting. They would make the "maybe" promise of coming back
            in a month or two. Huh? A month and a half later...still not ready.
        </p>

            I wasn't sure what to do next, until someone offered to connect me (and a bunch of other people from the same group)
            together into mastermind groups. It was awesome. I finally found a group of like minded entrepreneurs who actually
            knew what a mastermind was!

        <p>
            Initially there were six of us in the group. First thing we had to do was figure out a time we could all meet. Not
            all of us could meet at the same time, so we lost two members.
        </p>

            It' hard to believe but, this really hit me hard. I was thinking of how I would have felt if the same happened to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to do something about it. I wanted to give back. So I made a very lean iLOVEmasterminds.com. It was just the
            tool, no frills like blogs or about me pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, I've learned that most people want to be in a mastermind but they don't know how to run it or how too keep
            it thriving. That's why I started blogging. I want to be able to make every group I help put together a successful group.
